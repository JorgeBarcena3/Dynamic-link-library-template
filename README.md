# Dynamic link library template


This project is a template for an implementation of a dynamic link library in visual studio 2019. The solution contains two projects, the first generates the dynamic library (.dll and .lib), the second uses that library to see how it works.

⚠️ **The .dll and .lib files are exported in the "dllTestLibrary/lib/dllTestLibrary/" folder.**

⚠️ **To copy the .dll and .lib files to the documents of the demo project, use the windows xcopy command.**
